React does not give much guidance on how to construct applications. In order to even deploy a basic Hello World with React, you need to configure Babel and Webpack.

Facebook has created a tool to let us skip that setup with: [facebookincubator/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

This is a great start for JSX, ES6, linting, hot code reloading and build tools.

But, I normally need a lot more in my applications: Ajax, Redux, Redux Devtools, Authentication, etc..

It can be painful to set up all the pieces. There are over [18,000 react packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=react) on npm.

I prefer starting with a boiler plate project. I recommend using one of the following:

* [coryhouse/react-slingshot: React + Redux starter kit with Babel, hot reloading, testing, linting and a working example app, all built in](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot)
* [kriasoft/react-starter-kit: React Starter Kit — isomorphic web app boilerplate (Node.js, Express, GraphQL, React.js, Babel 6, PostCSS, Webpack, Browsersync)](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit)
* [infinitered/ignite: The unfair starting CLI, Generator, and more for React Native](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite)
* [este/este: Starter kit for full–fledged React apps. One stack for browser, mobile, server.](https://github.com/este/este)

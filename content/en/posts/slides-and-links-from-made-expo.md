Thanks for everyone who came to my sessions at <a href="http://madexpo.us/">MADExpo</a>!

If you came for JavaScript is Real Code, here’s my <a href="/javascript-is-real-code-slides-and-sample">previous post</a> containg slides and code.

If you came for Getting Git, here're my slides:

<b><a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/2w3B0V1p3q1n1v1n342y/getting%20git.pdf">Getting Git (pdf)</a></b>

And some links containing topics that I mentioned.

<a href="/random-git-goodness">Random Git Goodness</a> – some git tricks I mentioned.
